/*"There are 3 main parts in the function. The first - before the while loop which contains the actual game - is the initialization part.
  In this part we start by distributing the cards onto the board, and setting the visibility of the individual cards.
  The next part is the input handling. Here we first check whether the input is 'Q' in which case we break the while loop.
  Otherwise we split the message in a \textit{from}, and \textit{to} string.
  These messages are split when they encounter the '->' arrow symbol, which is a part of the game move format.
  Everything left of the arrow is added to the \textit{from} string, and everything right of it is likewise added to the \textit{to} string. \
  The last part is where the complexity increases. The purpose of this part is to check the validity of moves, and do the moves if they are valid.
  Here we have three sections. Moves from the foundation pile to the columns, moves from the columns to the foundation pile, and moves from the columns to other columns.
  Each of these types of moves have different validation criteria."*/
